"Wiki API," is a RESTful service that allows users to search for information using JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The main goal of the project is to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for searching through a collection of documents, such as a wikipedia page, articles and etc.

By utilizing the power of Node.js and Express.js, the API is able to handle multiple concurrent requests and respond quickly to user requests. Additionally, the use of MongoDB and Mongoose allows for efficient storage and retrieval of the data being searched through.

The API allows users to perform searches using keywords and also allow advanced query such as filtering by date, sorting by relevance and etc. It also provide pagination feature to make sure the search result is easy to read and manage.

The Wiki API is a versatile tool that can be used to build a wide range of applications such as internal company knowledgebase or research-oriented applications, providing users with quick and accurate access to the information they need.
